# Logic-App-Dev (Microsoft-Azure) _by Khoj Info.Pvt. Ltd._
A collection of Azure Logic Apps workflows demonstrating automation scenarios with step-by-step explanations

1) Logic App-1: This Logic App automatically replies to emails when a new email arrives in the inbox with the subject **"testing"**.
2) Logic App-2: Address validation using an HTTP trigger (if condition)
3) Logic App-3: Order status handling using a Switch control and HTTP trigger.
4) Logic App-4: This Logic App demonstrates how to use parallel branches in Azure Logic Apps so that multiple actions run at the same time.
5) Logic App-5: This Logic App receives an array of names via an HTTP POST request, appends "Hello " to each name, and returns the greetings array.
6) Logic App-6: This Logic App validates the group of a user from an HTTP POST request. It returns “Welcome Admin” if the user belongs to the Admin group; otherwise, it returns **Access Denied**.
7) Logic App-7: This Logic App receives an array of users via HTTP POST, checks which users belong to the Admin group, and returns.
8) Logic App-8: This Logic App receives an array of users via HTTP POST, checks which users belong to the Admin group, and returns.
9) Logic App-9: This Logic App receives an array of users via HTTP POST, checks which users belong to the Admin group, and returns.
10) Logic App-10 Logic App processes an array of employees sent via HTTP POST and performs multiple operations:
- Creates a CSV table of employees.
- Creates an HTML table of employees.
- Filters employees in the IT department.
- Selects employee names and joins them as a comma-separated string.
- Selects employee names and emails for structured output.
  
12) Logic App-11: This Logic App generates a CSV table of products and sends it via email repeatedly until a specified run count is reached.
13) Logic App-12: This Logic App runs on a scheduled recurrence, initializes variables, composes user data, and sends it via Gmail if a condition is met.
14) Logic App-13: This Logic App executes inline JavaScript code and returns the result as an HTTP response.
15) Logic App-14: This Logic App receives a number via HTTP POST request, validates the input, and returns whether the number is odd or even using inline JavaScript.
16) Logic App-15: This Logic App automatically saves attachments from incoming Outlook emails to Azure Blob Storage.
